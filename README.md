A complete retail sales analysis project using SQL and Power BI to uncover trends in product performance, customer behavior, and profit distribution. Ideal for business insights and data-driven decision-making.
This project explores a retail sales dataset to uncover trends in customer behavior, sales performance, and product categories using SQL and data visualization tools.

## 📌 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze sales data and extract valuable business insights such as:
- Best-selling products and categories
- Monthly sales trends
- Sales by region or store
- Customer buying patterns

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** – For querying and analyzing the dataset
- **Power BI / Excel** – For data visualization

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset contains information on:
- Order ID  
- Product details  
- Category & Sub-Category  
- Quantity & Sales  
- Discounts & Profit  
- Order Dates & Regions

## 💡 Key Features
- Cleaned and structured raw data
- Performed descriptive analysis using SQL queries
- Created visual dashboards to summarize insights

📈 Findings & Report
🏆 Top-Selling Products & Categories
- The "Office Supplies" category had the highest number of orders, but "Technology" generated the most revenue.
- Binders and Phones were among the most frequently sold items.
- Some low-cost products (like pens and paper) sold in high volume but had low profit margins.

📍 Sales by Region
- The Western region led in total sales and profit, while the Southern region had the lowest overall performance.
- Some regions with high sales volume showed reduced profitability due to discounts or returns.

📆 Sales Trends Over Time
- December consistently saw a peak in sales, likely due to holiday shopping.
- Sales dipped in February and August, showing potential off-season periods.
- Profit trends didn't always align with sales – indicating the need to control discounts and product mix.

💰 Profitability Insights
- High discount rates often led to negative profit on large orders.
- Products like Tables and Bookcases showed high sales but low or negative profit, suggesting inefficiency or pricing issues.
- Focusing on profitable product segments (like Phones and Accessories) can improve margins.

👥 Customer Behavior
- Most customers preferred mid-range priced products with occasional high-value purchases.
- Repeat orders were more common in the Technology segment, indicating brand or service loyalty.
- Customers in urban regions placed more frequent but smaller orders.

## 🚀 How to Use
